#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(logn) - as n grows, the runtime grows at a slower rate


b) O(nlogn) - The outer loop is O(n) which grows in a linear time complexity. The inner loop is O(logn) because the runtime for it grows at a slower rate as the input n increases. Thus O(nlogn)


c) O(n) - in this recursive algorithm, as the number of bunnies grows, the runtime will grow at the same rate

## Exercise II
